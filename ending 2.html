<h1>Ending 2</h1>

<p>You refuse to go along with things. It may be against your duty of observation, but you cannot allow this. You can't! You can't, you can't, you can't, you think, before the realization hits you that another key difference between you and them has just been made known. In your heated emotion, you blasted a crater through the area in front of you, leaving terrible destruction. Panicked eyes watch you, as you lament having no other choice but to run away.</p>
