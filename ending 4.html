<h1>Ending 4</h1>

<p>You accept. They help you up, just as they did before, and the two of you wave to the other... kind person. A wave is a goodbye and a greeting, you learn. You may see them again.</p>

<p>Soon enough, you and your new friend, perhaps, are sightseeing at a breakneck pace. This was the best opportunity to do your duty. Here, you can observe, learn from these new people, and maybe return to your home eventually... For now, however, this seems like a nice place. You feel a sense of contentment, despite the bad news you had receieved. They were right. This really could be your "home away from home." It's the first time you've heard the phrase, but it feels... Nice. Hopeful.</p>
